      "The player characters are hired by a mysterious fixer named Silver Shark to infiltrate a cargo ship called Arabia's Wish, which is rumoured to carry dangerous chemicals. The mission is to board the ship discreetly and find out what it's carrying. The characters depart at midnight in a speedboat driven by a woman named Ariel, who promises a weapon-free, quiet operation. As they navigate through the dense fog towards the ship, an explosion occurs, sinking the cargo ship and releasing a cloud of lethal hydrofluoric acid into the bay area. The characters must find shelter and seal themselves inside a bar called Paradise Lost to avoid the toxic cloud. \n",
      "\n",
      "Inside the bar, the players interact with various NPCs, some of whom are anxious, others suspicious, while others are outright hostile. The group must manage the tense atmosphere and discover the truth behind the explosion. They learn that the ship was blown up by terrorists and carries a dangerous chemical that, when mixed with the ship's cargo, produces the lethal cloud. A corporate representative named Elizabeth Schell attempts to control the situation and pin the blame on a Petrochem employee present in the bar, Simon. \n",
      "\n",
      "As the cloud spreads, the players must decide whom to trust and how to survive. They can explore various options, including sealing the bar, contacting outsiders for help, or negotiating with mysterious rescuers who arrive at the scene. The module also introduces a corporate conspiracy, as it's revealed that the chemical leak was orchestrated to damage Petrochem's reputation. The players can unravel this conspiracy and decide how to respond. Throughout the scenario, the characters face threats not only from the toxic cloud but also from potential enemies within the bar. [/INST]The boat and driver are ready. Hopefully, they aren't overly paranoid. Research on the Silver Shark, a small-time Fixer, doesn't turn up much. He operates in the waterways, dealing with \"entrepreneurs,\" so people don't talk about him much. However, Euros always help move conversations along.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire bay area is covered with a thick fog. The Del Coronado bridge can't even be seen from the boardwalk outside Paradise Lost. Upon arrival at the harbor rendezvous point, Ariel has her boat clean and ready. It is a small but spacious speedboat with a silent propulsion system and a large tarp that covers the back seats of the boat. She carries no weapons. \"If it comes to a shoot-out, my throttle arm is my best weapon. So let's make this quiet.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If party members start to doubt Ariel's loyalty, discourage the thought immediately. Here's a few things she might say: \"I don't back down from a deal. That results in a bad reputation and a short life.\" \"Hey, I'd like to keep my figure. That means it doesn't get punctured. I get you in, I get you out. I don't shoot back, got it?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Characters should be at water level when the explosion occurs. Initial survivability chances are higher, but consequences are as follows:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Characters behind cover/underneath the tarp have a 20% chance of catching shrapnel, and a 10% chance of catching fire.\n",
      "- Characters in the open have a 70% chance of getting caught by shrapnel, and a 50% chance of being exposed to flame.\n",
      "- The boat gets hit with shrapnel (roll 1d6 to determine number of times).\n",
      "\n",
      "After determining everyone's condition, roll for the appropriate consequences:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Shrapnel: Roll 1d6 to determine the number of pieces that impacted each player. Then roll for the body location of each piece. Shrapnel from the hull or interior of Arabia's Wish does 2d6 damage, and is considered armor-piercing. If characters are behind cover when hit, determine which body locations are exposed and which are behind the cover of the boat.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party boards Ariel's boat, and shortly before midnight they quietly leave dock. Ariel steers her speeder out of the harbor and sneaks through the misty night. She glides in closer toward the target point, searching desperately for some sign of Arabia's Wish, when at last she identifies its huge dark body in the still waters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those with enhanced vision of some variety are able to see the cargo ship more clearly. Ariel kills her engine and slides up next to the cargo ship's port side, silently alerting the team. Present the layout of the small speedboat (if you haven't already) and have players designate their exact location/marching order when the boat slips up next to Arabia's Wish.Area Covered by Tarp Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "Joe Solo was crouched behind a seat when the blast hit him, and he was hit by shrapnel. The CM rolls 1d6 to find out how many pieces hit him. The result is 3. He then rolls a 4, 6, and 9 for locations. The CM decides that Joe's head and torso were protected by the seat, but his arms and legs were exposed. Two of the three locations are hits: the 6 and the 9. Fortunately, Joe is armored with Skinweave, so this won't hurt too much.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Fire:\n",
      "\n",
      "Those characters exposed to flame from the blast suffer 2d6 damage the first round and 1d6 each following round until the fire is extinguished. Roll for a body location. The cover effects under shrapnel apply here as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "A thunderous clap accompanies the bright explosion as a huge tentacle of smoke worms its way toward the stars. Characters can notice immediately that the color of the smoke is an odd color. This does not bode well for the team.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Ariel survives the explosion, she attempts to veer the speeder away from Arabia's Wish and \"gun it\" for the nearest dockable location: the boardwalk just outside Paradise Lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "The boat, however, has engine problems due to shrapnel damage, so the trip takes longer than expected.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Ariel doesn't survive the explosion, characters are either going to attempt to pilot the vessel themselves or jump into the water and swim for the harbor. Characters with cyberlimbs most likely vote for the former option, as they easily sink if dropped in the water.\n",
      "\n",
      "In any case, the trip to the nearest \"solid surface\" occupies valuable time for the characters. The Movement Allowance (MA) stat for swimmers becomes a vital statistic, as well as the Swimming skill, if the speedboat is abandoned.\n",
      "\n",
      "Characters who observe the sinking of the cargo ship witness the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"As the burning ship descends beneath the waterline, the flames recede dramatically. A large, gaping hole in the side of the hull reveals several cylinders being tipped over as the ship takes on water. In the background, behind the menacing cloud, the hiss of liquids can still be heard.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Characters should be boating/paddling for their life by now.\n",
      "\n",
      "Those paranoid party members who were thoughtful enough to carry enviroscanners with them or submit to a biomonitor cyber enhancement receive early warning signs about the toxin and its effects. Pass notes to the characters with this active equipment and inform them of the situation with an abnormal reading that increases rapidly:\n",
      "\n",
      "\"UNKNOWN ACIDIC SUBSTANCE IN O2 ATMOSPHERE 50PPM / 90PPM / 212PPM / 472PPM...\"\n",
      "\n",
      "If the PCs jet away on the boat, their only obvious source of shelter is the harbor. Also, the boat may take a round or two to get started, since its engine has been damaged by the explosion.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't feel like using the boat as a method of escape just inform the party that it won't start. No means of climbing up to the surface.\n",
      "\n",
      "Because of the humidity and the fog, the sides of the buildings are very slick (most of them have aluminum siding). Characters should recognize the easy access via the boardwalk without much difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the party commits to one form of travel or another, place the HARBOR MAP where everyone can see it and mark their location. The original site of the cargo ship and the speedboat are marked on the map.\n",
      "\n",
      "If your team has taken another approach to boarding the vessel, and the boat is in another location, treat the spaces that the boat occupies as water hexes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boat Movement:\n",
      "\n",
      "- If the boat is being used, it has a movement rate of 5 per round (damaged). Divide its movement by two for the first turn as the boat picks up speed, rounding up.\n",
      "- The boat moves on the initiative of the driver.\n",
      "- Also, remember that a boat doesn't stop on a dime.\n",
      "- When the driver brakes to drop off its occupants, the boat makes a dramatic drop in speed, but continues for two hexes before coming to a dead drift.\n",
      "\n",
      "Swimming Movement:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Characters who have the skill Swimming take their RUN and divide it by four. This is the number of spaces they may swim in a combat round.\n",
      "- Characters who have the skill Athletics may swim at their RUN divided by four, but they must make an Average Athletics check every round to do so. If not, they move at their MA divided by three, rounding up.\n",
      "- Characters who don't have Swimming or Athletics move in the water at their MA divided by three, per round.\n",
      "- Subtract one space per round for each cyberarm that a character has, and two spaces per round for each cyberleg.\n",
      "- If the result is a negative number, that number represents the spaces he/she sinks each round without buoyancy (like a life vest).\n",
      "- A life vest slows down a swimmer one space per round, but it keeps him or her afloat!\n",
      "\n",
      "Example:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Joe Solo can't swim, and he never took Phys. Ed. in school.\n",
      "- His MA is 8. He moves in the water at a stunning 3 spaces per combat round.\n",
      "- His friend Bob Solo does have Swimming, and his RUN is 24.\n",
      "- Normally he swims at 6 spaces per round, but he recently came in need of a cyberarm, which slows him down to 5 spaces per round.\n",
      "\n",
      "This represents the gas cloud. At the end of the third round, the cloud consumes two more spaces in all directions. For each following round, the cloud expands at a dangerous four spaces per round, at an initiative of 16.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consult the Swimming Matrix on page 13 for fast reference during play.When the team members start to haul themselves up to the dock, they aren't necessarily concerned about finding shelter in the bar. They may be much more anxious to escape the cloud on foot by running down the alleys shown on the map and getting away in a vehicle (any vehicle, not just their own). If that option is seriously considered by your players, discourage these routes with the arrival of the friendly Harbor Patrol in a combat AV, hovering over the pier and spotlighting the alleys below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Obviously an explosion of that intensity will draw a crowd. Characters notice patrolmen leaning out the sides of the AV in full armor, looking down the alleys, and holding heavy assault rifles in their laps. If this still doesn't persuade them to find solace in the bar, have the patrolmen fire off a few warning shots at an NPC witness caught in the alleyway. Get the point across: no exit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Reaching the dock with turns to spare doesn't mean the characters can relax—no, no. The bar has to be sealed as best as possible from the incoming toxins. It is wise to make this suggestion to survivors who reach the boardwalk first, in case the party begins to develop an inflated paranoia about the capabilities of the cloud. Microscopic breaches in building structures or tiny leaks to the outside shouldn't permit a toxin of this size and weight into the establishment. This information could be known by someone with a military background, someone who has worked with Biotechnica on several occasions, or possibly another source.\n",
      "\n",
      "By now your players should be very interested in the movement and effects of the approaching cloud. You undoubtedly get some questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Is it spreading in all directions—even up?\n",
      "- How high does it plume, and does it stay there?\n",
      "- Is the cloud taller than the roofs of the buildings along the pier (which are two-story buildings, at most)?\n",
      "- Is the chemical toxin reacting with the water as well?\n",
      "- Is it heavier or lighter than the water?\n",
      "\n",
      "To address these questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Yes, it is spreading in all directions. That means it's harder to track, unless you happen to be the lucky PC with the gas sensor.\n",
      "- The cloud plumes to a height of about 200 feet, but it doesn't stay there. It moves along the ground, seeping into any available space.\n",
      "- Yes, the cloud is taller than the roofs of the buildings along the pier.\n",
      "- The chemical toxin is denser than water, and it sinks.\n",
      "\n",
      "#### Climbing to the Surface\n",
      "\n",
      "When Joe Solo reaches the dock, he can hoist himself up to the planking on his next turn (4 points) and move 4 more spaces to the front door of Paradise Lost, for a total of 8, his normal MA. Why be so picky about the number of spaces? Visually drawing a line to represent the ominous cloud generally makes things more horrific and intense. Players are able to visualize the size of the cloud, its speed, and their proximity to it. Characters who come dangerously close to being consumed by the cloud may notice dead fish surfacing around them. Characters who received wounds due to shrapnel feel just wonderful swimming in all that salt water. Don't forget to mention that fact to them. If the wounds are deep enough (a Serious wound, let's say) you might want to request a Resist Torture/Drugs test or suffer a loss to swimming spaces.Enviroscanner: These can be useful for something! In regards to the water, bay area pollution makes the chemical spill just as hard to see underwater as it is aboveground. The spill seems to spread around the sinking tanker like a dark well of ink. It could be heavier than water, but it's too hard to tell at the moment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hydrofluoric Acid:\n",
      "\n",
      "The gaseous chemical toxin that spilled out of Arabia's Wish produces an effect similar to a nerve agent. If a character is exposed to the toxin, whether by breath or by skin exposure, he/she immediately takes 1d6 damage per round. Body Type Modifiers do not apply in this instance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Skinweave delays the effects of the toxin for two rounds, because it takes longer for the gas to work its way into the victim's pores. The only combatant to the toxin is Toxin Binders, which subtract one point of damage from the result each round. The character makes the appropriate STUN and DEATH saves as damage accumulates. All attributes are reduced by half.\n",
      "\n",
      "The affected character feels dizzy and nauseated during the first few rounds as the toxin takes effect. Vision blurs as the optical membrane is eaten away (in cases of \"real\" eyes). The character feels burning sensations from exposed portions of his body as the calcium in his bones is digested by the acid.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once the toxin has done enough damage to place the character in a \"mortal wound\" status, the character starts vomiting repeatedly. At a rate of 1d6 per round, death is soon to follow. Exposed characters receive this damage until they are dead or shower themselves in distilled water thoroughly (3-4 hours).\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no specific treatment or cure for the aerosol acid produced by HF, except for a flushing of the system with water. The cloud has a concentration of hydrofluoric acid at approximately 5,000 ppm (parts per million). That's officially nasty, ladies and gentlemen.The explosion of the cargo ship outside has quickly drawn people to the windows, eager to see what disaster occurred. Characters entering the bar immediately notice groups of onlookers gathered tightly around the bay window. Some of them who noticed the party swimming/boating to the dock start to ask questions about the incident. As soon as the first NPC asks a question, others soon follow, presenting the party with dozens of questions during a time best used for sealing.\n",
      "\n",
      "A sample of the questions NPCs ask:\n",
      "- \"What's going on? What happened?\"\n",
      "- \"What was that? A boat?\"\n",
      "- \"What the hell is that strange white cloud coming this way? More fog?\"\n",
      "- \"Who are you guys?\"\n",
      "- \"Was that an explosion?\"\n",
      "- \"Is one of you responsible for this?\"\n",
      "- \"Frack, I hope no one was on that when it blew. Did you see it?\"\n",
      "- \"Why do you want towels?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the cloud races to the back door of Paradise Lost, characters most likely race to stuff the door frames with towels, rags, articles of clothing, or whatever they can find. No one has time to stop and answer questions. When the inhabitants of the bar begin to see why the characters are working so fervently, they cooperate.\n",
      "\n",
      "It takes 3 Movement Points to seal the bottom or top ridge of an outer door. It takes 5 Movement Points to seal the sides. The side door is the only door that needs to be sealed on the sides as well as the top and bottom. The other exterior doors are safe if sealed only on the bottom. In any case, it takes 4 Movement Points to seal each side of the window. No other entrances exist. It's a good idea to display the map of Paradise Lost at this time, so characters can count their movement within it as they race to seal the cracks. Keep the outdoor map on display as well, and remember to advance the cloud four spaces every round, on 16. If the door is sealed immediately thereafter, then the fumes dissipate to a non-toxic proportion. But if the fumes scare everyone off, they spread at a rate of one space in all directions every other round, at the end of each round.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Hint: It is a good idea to make sure that the doors are properly sealed in time, whether by player characters or non-player characters. Otherwise, this could be a very short scenario.**\n",
      "\n",
      "After the immediate threat has been resolved and the other doors have been sealed, the party finally has the opportunity to take a good look at the bar and who is in it. They are already familiar with the general layout (assuming they met Shark here earlier instead of demanding to meet elsewhere), so the occupants are most likely of greater interest.\n",

Twelve times. His racist, bigoted attitude has launched him into more fights than he can remember.

He was one of the people to run to the window and look outside at the rolling cloud making its way to the boardwalk. He knows what made that type of cloud. He knows how lethal exposure can be. But he doesn't know what happened, and his job, even his life, could be on the line. Especially if the spill isn't controlled quickly. He is the NPC most concerned about the incident and the one with the most knowledge of it. Of course, he's also probably the first one the party approaches to demand some answers. . .but he won't know. And he wasn't responsible for the explosion, though he may not get the opportunity to say so if guns are drawn.By now, the party has secured the bar and examined its occupants. The party takes one of two postures: passive (we need all the help we can get at this point) or aggressive (kill the bastard that set us up!). If the party takes an aggressive stance, things could change dramatically in moments. Everyone is anxious to know answers to their questions, but as soon as it becomes obvious that Shark knows the party and there is a relation between them and the explosion, the bar quiets down to overhear their conversation.\n",

Your lungs fill up with it and, and, and just burst! Oh jeez, I hope no one is outside right now. Oh man. Eddie—look how dark it is! Can you believe it? I don't believe it, man.

But what's really bothering her is one particular patron who has been drinking at the bar for most of the night: Jim Casey. He looks vicious. And she doesn't want to be near him when he goes off.

Maybe later.If, as a GM, you have other ideas about how to characterize the NPCs within the bar, feel free to pursue them on your own. Either they get along or they don't. In this small environment, you can create a palpable tension from many sources, all hinging on the fact that the cloud kills (or looks like it could kill, if no one has died from it yet).

Bullets of a smaller caliber cannot create a large enough hole with a single shot, but if a tight group of them penetrate the wall, it produces the same effect. Small leaks from bulletholes spread more slowly: one space into the bar on the round after the hole is made; then one neighboring space two rounds later; then another neighboring space two rounds after that, and continuing until all open spaces around the hole are filled with gas. Then it spreads into another space, and continues this way until the hole is patched or the gas fills the bar. In either approach, the most powerful weapon is the phone.

All of the windows of Paradise Lost slowly become frosty as the chemical etches the glass. After a period of a few minutes, it is virtually impossible to see outside.

      "- Hello operator: Elizabeth contacts the Night City Area Office of InterNet, states the situation, and suggests that all outgoing calls by phones with the bay area (555) prefix should be blocked until further evaluation of the crisis. She supports this by stating that InterNet will soon be flooded with hundreds upon hundreds of calls from that area by people witnessing the cloud, feeling the effects of the cloud, or even dying on the phone. As the situation has yet to be evaluated, InterNet will not be able to assist these people. Not even the police will be able to help, so the 911 emergency code from that area should be blocked and rerouted, says Elizabeth. Also, people will be calling out to anyone and everyone and sharing the crisis, which could quickly generate panic, violence, hostility, and eventually escalate to \"mob\" proportions. The authorities and the cleanup crews will have enough on their hands without hordes of crazy people generating riots. The night shift at InterNet isn't prepared for this type of crisis, so Elizabeth gets transferred from one representative to another until she reaches someone with authority (most likely waking them up in the process). She uses this to her advantage by sounding impatient, desperate, and angry.\n",
      "\n",
      "- The InterNet manager, unprepared and unaware of the magnitude of the situation, concedes to her demands with one exception: people calling in will receive a pre-recorded message stating that the situation is currently being controlled, and that help is on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "- What about cellular phones? InterNet can monitor them as well, and agrees to transfer all outgoing calls to the recording. However, cellular lines are harder to track, because they don't work off a landline or specified trunk; thus, it will be harder to \"catch\" all cellular calls from that area. There is a chance that cellular calls get through. Elizabeth states that she is unconcerned about a small number of cellular calls, and more interested in the large number of distress calls from non-cellular phones in that area.\n",
      "\n",
      "- InterNet finally agrees to monitor/transfer all calls to the prerecorded message. But only for two hours. After that, all outgoing calls can be made normally. And if InterNet receives different orders from city, state, or federal authorities, they obey them. Elizabeth agrees to these conditions. She's primarily interested in eliminating the chance of someone contacting a local media and feeding them damaging information about the effects of the spill or the original incident with the Petrochem cargo ship.\n",
      "\n",
      "The call block/transfer begins at 12:14 AM, and the message is as follows:\n",

But now, from the silence, a new sound arises. The mechanical whir and thud of a malfunctioned cyber-leg. The raspy, guttural sound of someone breathing with liquid in his or her lungs. The sound builds and builds until it reaches the back door.\n",
      "\n",
      "The doorknob turns repeatedly as the stranger tries to enter the bar. This poor cybered fellow managed to last much longer in the gaseous acid due to Toxin Binders and a lot of bioware. The acid is still eating his insides, just more slowly. Half-crazed, he says anything to get in away from the cloud (not that it helps).\n",

The person who opened the door is immediately affected: roll 1d6 for damage. If no one shoves him out of the way and shuts the door in the same round, the cloud will spread. As stated before, the gas spreads one space in all open directions, every other round, at the end of the round. Characters in any neighboring spaces feel lingering side-effects of the cloud in the form of an irritating \"burning\" sensation on exposed skin.\n",

      "Hopefully, the PCs are wise enough to keep the door shut. The stranger pleads with the inhabitants of the bar until he finally dies in a convulsing heap on the other side of the door at 1:02 AM—two minutes into the 1:00 report on Net 54.

      "This stranger was employed with Petrochem. He has no identification on him that links him to Petrochem, so that's not a problem.

      "\n",
      "Good morning. Just over an hour ago, the Petrochem tanker, Arabia's Wish, was headed for port in Del Coronado Bay here in Night City. The result was a dangerous toxic cloud that is slowly spreading into Night City through the Marina district and creeping frighteningly close to the heart of the downtown sector. Boats due to arrive in the bay area have been rerouted, and merchants already in the bay have been warned to evacuate. Neighboring area codes are now being affected.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Petrochem, the toxic mist produced from the sabotage is known as hydrofluoric acid, a version of hydrogen fluoride, or HF. Normally, HF is used to produce laundry detergent, silicon chips for semiconductors, and gasoline. In mist form, HF is very lethal. Exposure is through either inhalation or skin contact. Hydrofluoric acid is a clear, colorless and extremely corrosive mist that attacks skin and other soft tissues, enzymes, cell membranes, and also decalcifies bone. It is extremely lethal, and direct exposure will most likely result in instantaneous death.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you feel you may have been exposed to HF, these are the known symptoms:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Burns along exposed portions of skin.\n",
      "- Bleeding sores.\n",
      "- Blurred vision or blindness.\n",
      "- A hacking cough.\n",
      "- Breathing problems.\n",
      "- Severe irritation to the nose or throat.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you or anyone you know has exhibited these symptoms and you are outside the current affected area, please proceed to the nearest hospital. If you are near the affected area, please, do not panic. Measures are being taken to secure the toxin and neutralize it even as we speak.\n",

Things have been pretty hectic around here at the borderline. The public is in a state of chaos. This is much like a riot, and it's all the police can do to keep them from the Petrochem vans that hold the neutralizing solution. People here are in utter hysteria: if someone thinks someone else is showing symptoms of HF exposure, their first reaction is to shoot them before it spreads.\n",
      "\n",
      "What they've been trying to do for the past few minutes is to coat the windshields of their AVs with a special agent that will keep it from etching and frosting over. Then they plan to strafe the outer perimeter with an aerosol form of calcium gluconate. After that, they plan to spiral in deeper into the affected neighborhoods and release calcium gluconate much like the crop dusters did back in the 20th century. At the same time, a team of rescuers from each of the major streets will move in using ground transportation and go door-to-door to treat anyone affected with the toxin and evacuate the others. The ground trucks will also be spraying the gluconate, but from hoses, like a fire truck.\n",

      "What does this neutralizing agent look like? What will it do to the environment?\n",

      "The gluconate spray is really a fine gel that foams or expands somewhat after oxidization. It's also sticky. In spray form, as Petrochem has it here, it is too fine to determine much of a color, but I suspect we'll see something when it's applied to an entire neighborhood. I don't know if it will damage the environment any more than the environment is already damaged, but I am concerned about another issue concerning the gluconate. Nancy, as you must realize, the cloud has spread over an area of about four square miles. Now, that's a lot of ground to cover. And it is obvious that Petrochem lacks sufficient gluconate to—\n",

He works—or worked, rather—in the bay area. I had him put a team together to board Arabia's Wish at midnight.

If he's just been used as a scapegoat, then Simon is more than willing to stab Petrochem in the back by telling all he knows to a competitor. If he is a spy (which he isn't, but the PCs don't know that), then he needs the help of a major corporation to hide him away for a while until things cool down. Of course, the PCs may be more interested in \"cashing in\" on the reward money mentioned in the interview, but if they know that Simon was set up by Elizabeth, do they truly believe they will be able to just hand Simon over to Petrochem?

Mack is very suspicious about the whole deal, and he's still unsure who the real good guys are. Eddie has had too much of this whole incident, and sits quietly at a table with his head in his arms.

That means Simon, if he's out there somewhere, is now very interested in talking about Petrochem. He's probably furious right now, if he witnessed the interview. If DuPree could get Simon out of there quickly and quietly, Brenner could have something positive come from this whole crisis. Simon could testify that Petrochem was actually carrying HF on board when it blew, for \"unknown\" reasons. He would tell the public anything in return for his protection. Brenner makes a few phone calls, and within minutes a special team lifts off in a special, unlabelled AV bound for the heart of the chemical spill. The crew knows exactly where to go, since Brenner's quick research on Fixer Silver Shark stated that he operated out of a bar called Paradise Lost. If Ian Cornell hadn't told him the Fixer's name, the crew would've had to search the entire neighborhood. But he has the name. And soon he'll have Simon on his side.\n",
